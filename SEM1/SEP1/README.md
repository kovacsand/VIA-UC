## **Semester Project: Single User System**

Our task was to create a scheduling system for the Software Engineering programme. The administrator, i.e. the person planning the semester's schedule must be able to manage students, courses, teachers and sessions in a desktop application implemented in Java. The end-users, for example the students and teachers, must be able to view their schedule on a website.

*ECTS: 10*

### What I've done
  - Handle binary, .txt and .xml files in Java
  - Utilise OOP concepts, like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism
  - Implement GUI using JavaFX
  - Create a responsive website using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and bootstrap. I've created the home and the schedule pages (it might not display anything now due to insufficient data)
  - Analyise a problem based on an interview with a client
  - Draw various diagrams, including: class diagram, activity diagrams, sequence diagram
  - Manual use case testing
